# Web Application Security Assessment on OWASP Juice Shop

## Project Overview
This repository contains documentation and reports for a comprehensive web application security assessment conducted on [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/), a vulnerable web application designed for security training. The assessment followed the OWASP Top 10 standards, with an emphasis on identifying and exploiting common web vulnerabilities.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to conduct a penetration test on OWASP Juice Shop, using Burp Suite, and identify vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The findings were then documented, and solutions for mitigating these vulnerabilities were provided.

## Tools Used
- **Burp Suite**: A web vulnerability scanner and penetration testing tool.
- **OWASP Juice Shop**: A deliberately insecure web application created for security training purposes.

## Key Findings
During the security assessment, multiple vulnerabilities were discovered and exploited:

1. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Exploited a SQLi vulnerability to bypass authentication and retrieve sensitive information from the database.
2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Demonstrated XSS attacks that allowed session hijacking and stealing cookies.
3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Exploited a CSRF vulnerability to change user data without authorization.
4. **Session Hijacking**: Leveraged XSS attacks to hijack user sessions and perform unauthorized actions.

## Skills Acquired
Through this assessment, the following skills were developed:
- **Web Application Penetration Testing**: Hands-on testing of a web application for security vulnerabilities.
- **Burp Suite Proficiency**: Extensive use of Burp Suite features such as Proxy, Scanner, Intruder, and Repeater.
- **Vulnerability Exploitation**: Practical knowledge of exploiting common web vulnerabilities.
- **OWASP Top 10 Compliance**: Understanding and applying the OWASP Top 10 standards to web application security assessments.
- **Report Generation**: Creation of professional penetration testing reports, including technical details, proof of exploit, and mitigation recommendations.

## How to Run OWASP Juice Shop
To replicate this assessment, you can set up your instance of OWASP Juice Shop and use Burp Suite for testing.

### Step 1: Set up OWASP Juice Shop
You can deploy Juice Shop either by cloning the repository or using Docker:
```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop
Once deployed, access Juice Shop in your browser:

Copy code
http://localhost:3000
Step 2: Configure Burp Suite
Download and install Burp Suite.
Set up Burp Suite as the browserâ€™s proxy by configuring the browser to use 127.0.0.1:8080 as the proxy address.
Install the Burp Suite CA certificate in the browser to intercept HTTPS traffic.
OWASP Top 10 Focus
This project followed the OWASP Top 10 guidelines, and the vulnerabilities discovered corresponded with several of the top 10 categories:

Injection (SQL Injection)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Broken Authentication (Session Hijacking)
Sensitive Data Exposure (Exposed sensitive data through SQLi)
Documentation
